# ctags for XSLT

This is a work in progress.

It parses XSLT 1.0 and 2.0 files and writes a ctags file.

It is intended for use with vim's ctags functionality and vim's tagbar plugin

See https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar

> Although my primary focus is to develop this for vim, it can probably be adapted
> to work in other applications. (Editors such as emacs, notepad++ for example...)
